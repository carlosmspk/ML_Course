# Machine Learning Course

## Deep Learning (Regression)
Dataset : [Red Wine Quality](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)

Neural Networks used:
 - Multilayer Perceptron with all combinations of:
    - 1 or 2 hidden layers
    - 50, 100 and 500 neurons in first hidden layer
    - 100 neurons in 2nd layer (if used)
    - learning rates of .1, .01 and .001
    - single output neuron (regression) or multiple output neurons with softmax (classification)

## Deep Learning (Vision) - Part 1
Dataset : [The-massive-Indian-Food-Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/anshulmehtakaggl/themassiveindianfooddataset?select=Jalebi-Resize)

Neural Networks used:
 - Multilayer Perceptron ("Solution 1" in [results file](DeepLearning/results/indianfood.txt))
 - Convolutional Neural Network ("Solution 2" and "Solution 3" in [results file](DeepLearning/results/indianfood.txt))

## Deep Learning (Vision) - Part 2
Dataset : [MNIST digits classification dataset](https://keras.io/api/datasets/mnist/])

Neural Network used:
 - Convolutional Neural Network (reused the same network structure as in "Solution 3" in [results file](DeepLearning/results/indianfood.txt))
