In DeepLearning:
    1-Looked Kaggle.com for a complete yet simple dataset -> Wine Quality based on chemichal measurements
    2 - Data seems usable based on correlation values. Problem can be approached in two ways: predict wine quality from 0 to 10 as a continuous result (Regression problem) or look at the integers from 0 to 10 as different classifications (Multiclass Classification Problem). This is a supervised learning problem (we know what the output should be) and https://towardsdatascience.com/types-of-neural-network-and-what-each-one-does-explained-d9b4c0ed63a1 tells me I should use Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) which is the fancy term for "the original, simple, feedforward Neural Network". It works both for regression and classification.
        2.1 - Checked if sklearn (package I was using for machine learning before) is apt for building Neural Networks -> it has some models, but has very little flexibility. Will use Keras instead.
        3.1 - Searched for example on any keras MLP model for regression online -> https://machinelearningmastery.com/regression-tutorial-keras-deep-learning-library-python/
