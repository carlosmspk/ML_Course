what if data is not linearly separable by an hyperplane?
We use the kernel trick: transform your data into an higher dimension, such that it becomes linearly seperable, through some function, phi(x).

Examples:
> RBF Kernel
k(x,z) = 
exp(- ||x-z||^2 / (2^(sigma^2)))

> Primal problem:
for each i in (1,2,...,n)
Ei = max(0, 1.yi(W^T*X - b))

minimize 1/n sum( Ei + Î»|W|^2)
subject to: yi(W^T*X - b) >= 1 - Ei
Ei >= b, for all i
